# Online Book Store (Java SQL JDBC)

Welcome to the Online Book Store project! This is a Java application that simulates the basic functionality of an online book store using SQL for data storage and JDBC for database connectivity.

## Features

- **Database Connectivity**: Establishes a connection to a MySQL database using JDBC.
- **SQL Operations**: Performs fundamental SQL operations, including retrieving book information and handling orders.
- **Basic User Interaction**: Allows users to browse books and place orders.
- **Book Inventory Management**: Administrators can add, update, or remove books from the store's inventory.

## Getting Started
